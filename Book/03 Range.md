# Range in RegEx

```javascript
[abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz] type
```
this denotes the String literal "type" & can have all the lowercase characters from **a to z**
but this is more of a lengthy job & have the hight chances of a human errors
instead we can use range in regex.

```javascript [a-z]type ```
